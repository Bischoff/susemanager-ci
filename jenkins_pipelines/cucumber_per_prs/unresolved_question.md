## issue/unresolved pb:

1) on the same slave-jenkins, it's possible to build 2/3 branch pkgs in parallel or there is race condition?

2) The obs interface (waiting/etc) can be problematic slow, but maybe there is another way to improve it.

3) need to inject to controller the right branch from the pr (at moment this is not the case)
